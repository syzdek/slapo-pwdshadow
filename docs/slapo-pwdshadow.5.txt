NAME
       slapo-pwdshadow	 -   Password  Policy  conversion  to  RFC2256	Shadow
       attribtues overlay

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The pwdshadow overlay translates the attributes	used  by  the  ppolicy
       overlay into attributes compatible with the attributes in the shadowAc-
       count object class defined by RFC2307.	The  attribtues  generated  by
       pwdshadow  can be used instead of the manually maintained attributes of
       shadowAccount.


CONFIGURATION
       These slapd.conf(5) configuration options apply to the pwdshadow  over-
       lay. They shoud appear after the overlay directive.


       pwdshadow_default <policyDN>
	   Specify  the DN of the pwdPolicy and pwdShadowPolicy objects to use
	   when no specific policy is set on a given user's entry. If there is
	   no  specific  policy for an entry and no default is given, then the
	   attributes pwdShadowInactive, pwdShadowMax, pwdShadowMin, and  pwd-
	   ShadowWarning  will	not  be  generated.  The default policy may be
	   specified in the config backend by setting olcPwdShadowDefault.


       pwdshadow_use_policies on | off
	   Specifies that the pwdPolicy and pwdShadowPolicy attributes	should
	   be  retrieved from the DN specified by either the pwdPolicySubentry
	   attribute (if present in the directory user's entry)  or  the  pwd-
	   shadow_default  configuration  option.  If this option is disabled,
	   then only the pwdShadowLastChanged and  pwdShadowExpire  attributes
	   will  be  generatd  by the overlay. This option may be specified in
	   the config backend by setting olcPwdShadowUsePolicies.  The default
	   is on.


       pwdshadow_overrides on | off
	   The generated values for pwdShadow attributes can be manually over-
	   ridden by setting the equivalent shadowAccount  attributes  on  the
	   directory  user's entry. This option may be specified in the config
	   backend by setting olcPwdShadowOverrides.  The default is on.


OBJECT CLASS
       pwdshadow overlay depends on the pwdPolicy and  pwdShadowPolicy	object
       classes.   The  definition  of  pwdPolicy  is documented by slapo-ppol-
       icy(5).	The definition of pwdShadowPolicy is as follows:

       (  1.3.6.1.4.1.27893.4.2.3.1
	      NAME 'pwdShadowPolicy'
	      DESC 'Attributes for controlling pwdShadow overlay'
	      SUP top
	      AUXILIARY
	      MAY ( pwdShadowAutoExpire ) )

       Every account that should have generated  pwdShadow  attributes	should
       have a pwdPolicySubentry attribute containing the DN of a valid pwdPol-
       icy and pwdShadowPolicy entry and should have set the pwdShadowGenerate
       attribute (its value is TRUE) on the account's entry.


OBJECT CLASS ATTRIBUTES
       The following details the meaning and use of attributes of the pwdShad-
       owPolicy object class.


       pwdShadowAutoExpire
	   If this attribute is set (its value is TRUE) in the pwdShadowPolicy
	   object  and	pwdEndTime  is	not  set on the user's entry, then the
	   value of pwdShadowExpire will be calculated by adding the values of
	   pwdShadowLastChange,   pwdShadowMax,   and  pwdShadowInactive.   If
	   either pwdShadowLastChange or  pwdShadowMax	are  not  set  on  the
	   user's  entry,  then  no value will be set for pwdShadowExpire.  If
	   pwdShadowInactive is not set on the user's entry,  then  a  default
	   value of zero is used for pwdShadowInactive.

	      EQUALITY booleanMatch

OPERATIONAL ATTRIBUTES
       The  operational attributes used by the pwdshadow overlay are stored in
       the user's entry. Most of these	attributes  are  not  intended	to  be
       changed	directly  by  users;  they  are  used  to  present  the policy
       attributes from the ppolicy module in a	format	compatible  with  most
       LDAP auth implementations used by Linux distributions. However, if pwd-
       shadow_overrides is enabled, the values of the  operational  attributes
       generated  by  the  overlay may be overridden by setting the equivelent
       shadowAccount attributes on the directory user's entry. The operational
       attributes  have  been detailed here so that systems administrators can
       configure their systems to use the generated LDAP attributes.


       userPassword
	   The userPassword attribute is not part of  the  pwdshadow  overlay,
	   however  it is tracked by the overlay. Please refer to the standard
	   OpenLDAP schema for its definition.


       pwdEndTime
	   The pwdEndTime attribute is not part of the pwdshadow overlay, how-
	   ever  it  is  used to determine the value of pwdShadowExpire if the
	   attribute shadowExpire is  not  present  on	the  directory	user's
	   entry.  Please  refer  to the man page for slapo-ppolicy(5) overlay
	   for its definition.


       pwdPolicySubentry
	   The pwdPolicySubentry attribute is not part of the pwdshadow  over-
	   lay,  however  it is used to determine the pwdPolicy and pwdShadow-
	   Policy subentry that is to be used for  this  particular  directory
	   user.  Please refer to the man page for slapo-ppolicy(5) module for
	   its definition.


       pwdShadowGenerate
	   The pwdShadowGenerate attribute controls if	the  module  generates
	   attributes  for this particular directory user. If the attribute is
	   not present or is not set (its value is "FALSE"), then  the	module
	   will not generate attributes for this particilar directory user. If
	   this attribute is removed from the directory user or is unset  (its
	   value   changes   from  "TRUE"  to  "FALSE"),  then	this  module's
	   attributes will be removed from the directory user. If attribute is
	   set	(added	with  or  changed to a value of "TRUE"), then the pwd-
	   Shadow attributes will be generated	and  added  to	the  directory
	   user's entry.

       pwdShadowExpire
	   This  attribute contains the date of the expiration of the account,
	   expressed as the number of days since January 1, 1970.  If  pwdEnd-
	   Time  is  present  on  the  user's  entry,  then pwdShadowExpire is
	   derived from the value of pwdEndTime.  If pwdEndTime is not present
	   on  the user's entry and pwdShadowAutoExpire is set on the pwdShad-
	   owPolicy object's entry, then pwdShadowExpire is derived by	adding
	   the values of pwdShadowLastChange, pwdShadowMax, and pwdShadowInac-
	   tive.  Both pwdShadowLastChange and pwdShadowMax must be present on
	   the	user's	entry  to  generate  the value using autoexpire.  This
	   attribute can be overriden by setting shadowExpire.

       pwdShadowFlag
	   The overlay does not generate a value for this  attribute.	It  is
	   included  by  the  overlay  for completeness. This attribute can be
	   overriden by setting shadowFlag.

	      USAGE directoryOperation )


       pwdShadowInactive
	   The number of days after a password has expired  during  which  the
	   password  should still be accepted. If pwdGraceExpiry is present on
	   the pwdPolicy object's entry,  then	pwdShadowInactive  is  derived
	   from  the value of pwdGraceExpiry.  This attribute can  be  overri-
	   den	by setting shadowInactive.

       pwdShadowLastChange
	   This attribute contains the	date  of  the  last  password  change,
	   expressed  as  the  number  of  days  since	January 1, 1970.  This
	   attribute  is  set  to  the	current  date  when  the  userPassword
	   attribute  is  updated. If pwdShadowGenerate is set after the pass-
	   word was set and pwdChangedTime is present  on  the	user's	entry,
	   then  pwdShadowLastChange  is derived from the value of pwdChanged-
	   Time.  This attribute can be overriden by setting shadowLastChange.

       pwdShadowMax
	   The	number of days following the last password change on which the
	   password must again be changed.  pwdMaxAge is present on  the  pwd-
	   Policy  object's entry, then pwdShadowMax is derived from the value
	   of pwdMaxAge.  This attribute can be overriden by  setting  shadow-
	   Max.

       (  1.3.6.1.4.1.27893.4.2.1.7

	      USAGE directoryOperation )


       pwdShadowMin
	   The	minimum  number  of  days  after the password was last changed
	   before the password may again be changed. If pwdMinAge  is  present
	   on  the pwdPolicy object's entry, then pwdShadowMin is derived from
	   the value of pwdMinAge.  This attribute can be overriden by setting
	   shadowMin.

       pwdShadowWarning
	   The	number of days before a password is going to expire. If pwdEx-
	   pireWarning is present on the pwdPolicy object's entry,  then  pwd-
	   ShadowWarning  is derived from the value of pwdExpireWarning.  This
	   attribute can be overriden by setting shadowWarning.
